Network traffic analysis can be host based analysis or network based analysis in level of abstraction.
from an element perspective, a host based analysis is made of hosts, time, protocols and packet info.
from a host perspective, the hosts are made of more than one host.
a host has a number of hosts.
the range of a host's number of hosts is integer.
protocols have a protocol type.
the range of the protocols' protocol type is string with values http, ip, tcp and ethernet.
the protocols' protocol type depends on the host's number of hosts.
